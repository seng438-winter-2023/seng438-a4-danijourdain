# Introduction

This assignment built two different software testing skills. The first one that was tested was mutation testing. This was done using the Pitest PIT mutation tool. This allowed us to improve the coverage of our test suite from the last two assignments even further by applying more test development techniques. The second half of this lab shifted focus to GUI testing. This was done by using Selenium to test a popular shopping website while also comparing it to a second tool called Sikuklix. These tests focued on testing popular and common use cases for the site and allowed us to test out these tools on actual web pages.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

## X killed Mutants

## Y surviving Mutants

### [IDK HOW TO GET NUMBERS OF MUTANTS] Incremented (++a) double local variable number 1

In the Range constructor, when lower was incremented before setting this.lower = lower, the value of this.lower is now incorrect. This Mutant was not initally killed, but in our improvements, the constructorReturnsCorrectObject() test case catches and kills this Mutant now. The expected value would be 3 for the lower bound of the range, but this Mutant would cause it to be 4.

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

After using the PIT mutation testing on each class, many more lines and edge cases in the code were covered by our tests. This allowed for more mutations to be killed and also increased the quality of our test suite. This will allow for the suite to catch more bugs as the code is being looked at more closely and will result in more code that is error free. However, we do belive this method can be overboard for classes with a lot of mutations. We had already covered the majority of the mutations before this testing and due to the amount of mutations in the code (687 for DataUtilities and 1259 for Range), it was extremely time consuming and ineffective to use this method. One test would usually only kill 1 or 2 mutations which made increasing the mutation coverage extremely hard.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants ended up bringing our score down quite a lot. Some mutants such as post-incrementing a local variable when returning it do not change the output or behaviour of the code. These Mutants survived through all of our test cases of course since they do not change the functionality of the source code. Because of this, our mutation score was lower than it should have been. Because these do not change the function of the source code, these Mutants should not affect the mutation score.

We designed our test cases around the Ikea web page and divided it such that each member in our group covers two tests. Find below the tests covered by each team member and an explination at why we covered those tests.

## Ethan

1. Search for an item using a photo
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click on the camera found in the search bar
    - Select the picture with a night stand and bed
    - Select DVALA
2. Add item to shopping list while not logged in
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click the menu at the top left of the page
    - Select Products -> Home décor -> Mirrors
    - Click on Large Mirrors and then select NISSEDAL
    - Press on the heart to add it to your shopping list
    - Select the heart at the top of the page to go to your shopping list
    - Refresh the page to ensure it stays in your shopping list
    - Press on the NISSEDAL mirror and then remove it from your shopping list

### Explanation

The first test case will allow users to search for items that they do not necissarily know the name of or even find items that fit their current room by uploading their own photo. This will help the user recieve results that are much more relevant to them.

The second test case will allow us to look at if the site runs properly for users  who do not have an account. This specifically checks to see if these users can search for items that interest them and then save those items to their wish list/shopping list. Refreshing the page allows us to ensure that their choices are saved even when they leave the page if they want to come back to them later in order to buy the items.

## Danielle

1. Log in to an existing account
    - Start on [ikea.com](ikea.com)
    - Click on "Go Shopping"
    - Click on the small person icon in the top right corner with the text "Hej! Log in or sign up"
    - Click the "sign in" button
    - Enter an invalid email and password and click "Continue"
    - Dismiss the invalid log in message
    - Enter a valid email and password and click "Continue"
2. Log in, add an item to cart, log out, then log back in
    - Start on [ikea.com](ikea.com)
    - Click on "Go Shopping"
    - Sign in using valid credentials (from the functionality above)
    - Select Products -> Home décor -> Plants & Flowers
    - Select Artificial plants & flowers
    - Click the shopping basket icon on SMYCKA to add one to cart
    - Click the person icon and then Sign out
    - Sign back in using the earlier steps
    - Ensure the SMYCKA is still in the cart

### Explanation

The first test case is important for frequent shoppers. Having an account to save their information and preferences is an important function that creates a more enjoyable shopping experience. Creating an account grants access to many more features that a guest user will not have.

The second test case will allow users to keep track of their cart between multiple shopping sessions. It specifically checks if a user can add to their cart, log out, then log back in and have the same item saved.

## Labib

1. Select Ikea store and change Location
    - Open Ikea site
    - Press the Location Selector at the top right
    - Press Select a different store --> See full list of stores
    - Select IKEA Edmonton
    - Visit store page
2. Add item to cart multiple times
    - Open Ikea site
    - Select Products --> All furniture --> Gaming furniture
    - Press Gaming accessories and select LÅNESPELARE
    - Add the item to cart and return to the main menu
    - Select Products --> All furniture --> Gaming furniture
    - Press Gaming accessories and select LÅNESPELARE
    - Increase the number to add to cart to two
    - Add the items to cart and return to the main menu
    - Select your shopping cart (top right) and verify that three LÅNESPELARE's are in the cart
    - Reset the cart

### Explanation

The first test case is important for shoppers who need to change their location due to travel. Allowing users to pick a location that best suits them is very important as it allows the shopper to see items specific to that Ikea as well as find the actual location of the store if they need to pick anything up.

The second test case lets a shopper add an item multiple times to their cart. It checks if they can add it from the main menu multiple times as well as add more than one item at once. This also makes sure that the items stored in the cart are saved after navagating away from the page or refreshing the browser.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Originally we planned to split the assignment into 4 even sections, with each of us completing a quarter of the mutation testing, and completing 2 use cases for the GUI testing. However due to some technical issues that are discussed in detail in the next section, we were unable to do this. Three of our group members worked on the mutation testing and GUI testing. Our fourth group member focused on GUI testing and working on the report to make up for the missed work. All members contributed to the report but the fourth member took on a bit more of the effort.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

This lab ended up being exceptionally difficult. The PIT mutation testing tool did not work properly on Mac. After running all the mutation tests, the report would be generated, but before it could be analyzed or exported, Eclipse would crash. This was tested several times on a Mac user's machine, but since it took almost 15 minutes to run every time, we had to move on quickly to avoid wasting too much time. Thankfully we had several group members who had powerful Windows machines and were able to run the mutation tests. Because this Assignment also included the GUI testing, we were able to still divide the work up mostly evenly. After much experimentation and collaboration, we were still unable to figure out how to get the PIT testing working on a Mac.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The main issue with this lab was the lack of cross-platform compatibility. Because of the issues mentioned in the previous section, we wasted a large amount of time as a group troubleshooting and trying to get the PIT testing working for all members. It would be appreciated in the future if there was a heads-up about potential issues on specific operating systems. It was also very annoying that running the PIT mutation test could take upwards of 15 minutes each time we wanted to see how much progress has been made when attempting to kill more mutations. This was very time consuming and was a very ineffective way of unit testing. Overall, obtaining an increase of 10% on the mutation score was impossible as well since we already had very high mutation scores for both the Range and DataUtilities tests. This left only very obscure mutations that by no menas should ever need to be focused on and even when we did create tests for them, it would not increase the score at all since it only killed one mutation (out of over 650-1250). Creating enough tests to reach an 100% mutation coverage is not reasonabe for the given timeframe as we are all busy and it also does not teach us anything. The lab instructions should be changed in order to cover what to do in this edge case. For example, we have over 120 tests for both these classes which is more tests than actually needed to thoroughly test each class and we still were not able to reach the 10% increase for each class.

It was really appreciated to include a rubric breaking down the contents of the lab report! We found it really helpful when writing the report to have something to reference aside from section headers to make sure we were on the right track.
