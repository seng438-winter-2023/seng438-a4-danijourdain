# Introduction

This assignment built two different software testing skills. The first one that was tested was mutation testing. This was done using the Pitest PIT mutation tool. This allowed us to improve the coverage of our test suite from the last two assignments even further by applying more test development techniques. The second half of this lab shifted focus to GUI testing. This was done by using Selenium to test a popular shopping website while also comparing it to a second tool called Sikuklix. These tests focued on testing popular and common use cases for the site and allowed us to test out these tools on actual web pages.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

## 7 killed Mutants

### 90.6: Negated double local variable number 3

In the constructor for Range, replacing `if (lower > upper)` with `if (lower > -upper)` will change the behaviour of the constructor, as it will result in valid range objects throwing Exceptions, in cases where lower is smaller than upper, negating upper results in the opposite of the actual inequality, except in cases where upper = 0. This mutant was killed by shiftWithoutZeroCrossingLowerBoundZero negating since it constructed a range (0,3) negating upper in this case would have the test throw an exception and fail.

### 95.1: Removed assignment to member variable lower

In the constructor for Range, replacing `this.lower = lower` with nothing instead will change the behaviour of the constructor, as it will the lower bound being unassigned/uninitialized. This was killed by a number of tests, as any operation on an unitialized variable should yield wrong results, for example, lengthShouldBeTwo would kill the mutant because lower would be auto initialized as 0 which would result in failing the test.

### 123.16: Incremented (++a) double field lower

In the getLength method, replacing the statement `return this.upper - this.lower` with `return ++this.upper - this.lower` will change the behaviour of the statement. The returned value will be higher than the actual value that should be returned. This was killed by the lengthShouldBeTwo test case. This test case ensures the getLength method returns the correct value, killing this mutant.

### 132.24: Replaced double addition with division

In the getCentralValue method, replacing the statement `return this.lower / 2.0 + this.upper / 2.0` with `return this.lower / 2.0 / this.upper / 2.0` will change the behaviour of the statement. The returned value will not be the same as the actual value that should be returned. This was killed by the getCentralValueShouldBeZero test case. This test case ensures the getCentralValue returns the correct value, killing this mutant.

### 157.16: incremented (++a) double local variable 1

In the intersects method, replacing the statement `if (b0 <= this.lower)` with `if (++b0 <= this.lower)` will change the behaviour of the statement. The returned value will not be the same as the actual value that should be returned due to the change in the inequality. This was killed by the intersectsShouldBeTrueWithEqualRange test case. This test case ensures the intersects returns the correct value when the arguments are equivalent to the range, killing this mutant because `-1 <= -1` is not equal to `0 <= -1`.

### 161.16: Negated double field upper

In the intersects method, replacing the statement `return (b0 < this.upper && b1 >= b0)` with `return (b0 < -this.upper && b1 >= b0)` will change the behaviour of the statement. The returned value will not be the same as the actual value that should be returned due to the change in the inequality. This was killed by the intersectsShouldBeTrueWithPartiallyOverlappingUpperRange test case. This test case ensures the intersects returns the correct value when the arguments (0,2) overlap the the upper region of the example range (-1,1), killing this mutant because `0 < 1` is not equal to `0 < -1`.

### 303.2: Negated double field upper

In the expandToInclude method, replacing the statement `return new Range(value, value);` with `return null;` will change the behaviour of the statement. The returned value will be a null object instead of a valid range object. This was killed by the expandToIncludeStartingRangeNull test case. This test case ensures expandToInclude handles having the first argument being null correctly, the expected behaviour is having the method return a range object with both bounds beign equal to teh second argument, which is killed by our test because `null.getUpperBound != 4.3` which fails the assertion.

## 3 surviving Mutants

### 92.11: incremented (++a) double local variable 3

In the Constructor for range, replacing the statement `+ ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";` with `+ ") <= upper (" + (++upper) + ").";` will change the behaviour of the constructor. When an invalid range is in the constructor it will still throw an exception, but this mutant changes the msg attached to the exception. This mutant survived because although we check if an exception is thrown, we don't have a test that validates the message that comes with said exception.

### 132.27: Replaced double addition with modulus

In the getCentralValue method, replacing the statement `return this.lower / 2.0 + this.upper / 2.0` with `return this.lower / 2.0 % this.upper / 2.0` will change the behaviour of the statement. The returned value will not be the same as the actual value that should be returned. This survived due to our example range being (-1,1), 1/2 mod -1/2 is 0, which coincidentally is the central value of the Range used in the test.

### 157.13: incremented (a++) double field lower

In the intersects method, replacing the statement `if (b0 <= this.lower)` with `if (b0 <= (this.lower++))` will change the behaviour of the statement. The returned boolean will not always be equivalent to the actual value, and it has the added result of changing the boundaries of the caller. This survived due to us not asserting that the bounds of the caller remain the same after calling the intersects method.

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

After using the PIT mutation testing on each class, many more lines and edge cases in the code were covered by our tests. This allowed for more mutations to be killed and also increased the quality of our test suite. This will allow for the suite to catch more bugs as the code is being looked at more closely and will result in more code that is error free. However, we do belive this method can be overboard for classes with a lot of mutations. We had already covered the majority of the mutations before this testing and due to the amount of mutations in the code (687 for DataUtilities and 1259 for Range), it was extremely time consuming and ineffective to use this method. One test would usually only kill 1 or 2 mutations which made increasing the mutation coverage extremely hard.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants ended up bringing our score down quite a lot. Some mutants such as post-incrementing a local variable when returning it do not change the output or behaviour of the code. These Mutants survived through all of our test cases of course since they do not change the functionality of the source code. Because of this, our mutation score was lower than it should have been. Because these do not change the function of the source code, these Mutants should not affect the mutation score.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

Based on the mutatnts that survived our initial program, we noticed a pattern of mutants surviving when we didn't check the member variables of an object after calling fucntions. So, a lot of the issues arised from us focusing on the return of a function while ignoring the object that made the call in the first place. Based on that, we decided to find and add tests that ensure the member variables are no altered by any function unless stated otherwise in the documentation. <br>

The other type of mutants of survived were related to how most of our tests on the range class used a range of (-1,1), which made calculating values to use assertions easier, but had the unintended effect of mutants containing incrementation or decrementation surviving. So for this group of mutants we decided to add more specialized range objects in functions where these mutants could survive.

Our efforts were mostly focused on eliminating all we can from these 2 groups in the beginning, since that would weed out most of the surviving mutants. The rest of the mutants we killed were miscellaneous and needed specific tests to be written on a case by case basis.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Mutation testing allows us to put the robustness of our test cases to the test. It ensures that our test suite will be able to handle as many possible faults in the system as possible. Although these faults may not exist currectly, it is possible that similar faults could be introduced in future version.

## Advantages

The main advantage of mutation testing is the increased quality of the test suite. By using mutation testing, we are able to discover the weak points of our test cases. This allowed us to redesign some existing test cases as well as design new ones to cover more potential problems with the SUT. Another advantage of mutation testing is the improved regression testing for future versions. By building a test suite that can catch faults that do not exist in the actual source code, the test suite will be more likely to catch faults that are introduced in new versions. Another advantage of it is the fact that it can be done automatically by tools such as PIT which was used in this lab.

## Disadvantage

The main disadvantage of mutation testing is the extra time it takes to develop. This time mainly comes from having to develop new test cases. However, it also takes a long time to read and understand the reports generated explaining the mutants. Due to the intense process of running mutation testing tools, it can take a long time to receive results, and on some less powerful machines, results may never be generated.

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

We designed our test cases around the Ikea web page and divided it such that each member in our group covers two tests. Find below the tests covered by each team member and an explination at why we covered those tests.

## Ethan

1. Search for an item using a photo
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click on the camera found in the search bar
    - Select the picture with a night stand and bed
    - Select DVALA
2. Add item to shopping list while not logged in
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click the menu at the top left of the page
    - Select Products -> Home décor -> Mirrors
    - Click on Large Mirrors and then select NISSEDAL
    - Press on the heart to add it to your shopping list
    - Select the heart at the top of the page to go to your shopping list
    - Refresh the page to ensure it stays in your shopping list
    - Press on the NISSEDAL mirror and then remove it from your shopping list

### Explanation

The first test case will allow users to search for items that they do not necissarily know the name of or even find items that fit their current room by uploading their own photo. This will help the user recieve results that are much more relevant to them.

The second test case will allow us to look at if the site runs properly for users  who do not have an account. This specifically checks to see if these users can search for items that interest them and then save those items to their wish list/shopping list. Refreshing the page allows us to ensure that their choices are saved even when they leave the page if they want to come back to them later in order to buy the items.

### Explanation

The first test case is important for frequent shoppers. Having an account to save their information and preferences is an important function that creates a more enjoyable shopping experience. Creating an account grants access to many more features that a guest user will not have.

The second test case will allow users to keep track of their cart between multiple shopping sessions. It specifically checks if a user can add to their cart, log out, then log back in and have the same item saved.

## Labib

1. Select Ikea store and change Location
    - Open the Ikea website
    - Press the Location Selector at the top right
    - Press Select a different store --> See full list of stores
    - Select Ikea Edmonton
    - Press visit store page
2. Add item to cart multiple times
    - Open Ikea website
    - Select Products --> All furniture --> Gaming furniture
    - Press Gaming accessories and select LÅNESPELARE
    - Add the item to cart and return to the main menu
    - Select Products --> All furniture --> Gaming furniture
    - Press Gaming accessories and select LÅNESPELARE
    - Increase the number to add to cart to two
    - Add the items to cart and return to the main menu
    - Select your shopping cart (top right) and verify that three LÅNESPELARE's are in the cart
    - Reset the cart

### Explanation

The first test case is important for shoppers who need to change their location due to travel. Allowing users to pick a location that best suits them is very important as it allows the shopper to see items specific to that Ikea as well as find the actual location of the store if they need to pick anything up.

The second test case lets a shopper add an item multiple times to their cart. It checks if they can add it from the main menu multiple times as well as add more than one item at once. This also makes sure that the items stored in the cart are saved after navagating away from the page or refreshing the browser.

## Mohammed

1. Search Items using Text
    - Open Ikea site
    - Click on the search bar at the top of the page
    - Type in search term and Enter
    - Add First item in list to cart
    - [If the search term is invalid show no results screen]
2. Create New Wish list and rename it
    - Open Ikea site
    - Click on wish list logo (heart)
    - Click on Create List button
    - Type in name and confirm input
    - Click on the three dots beside the new wish list
    - Click on rename
    - Type new name and confirm

### Explanation

The first test case is important for shoppers who want to find a certain product avoiding tireless scrolling. It check if the search bar can accurately find an item that matches the name typed in, and if it cannot find one, it should be able to inform the user that the phrase typed in does not have any matches in the store.

The second test case is more of a quality of life test. It tests if new wish lists can be added, and if that first process is handeled properly, it then checks if the wishlist can be renamed and if those changes persist with the page.

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

During test case development, we would use breakpoints to ensure the test case was proceeding as desired. We would ensure the webpage was in the desired state and would continue as intended. Once the test case was running as desired, we added assertion statements to the test cases. In Selenium IDE, this was done as a "verify element present" commmand with one of the elements unique to the test case selected. This allowed us to make sure that our test case would run to completion, and that it would product the desired result with the desired elements on the page.

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data

Throughout our test case development, we made sure to use a variety of data to test the website. The main way we did this was by choosing different products for each test case. We made sure to use a variety of products from many different categories including but not limited to plants, mirrors, and gaming products. This way we were able to ensure the website would work in many different contexts and produce the correct result no matter the product.

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

Selenium is an easy to use and intuitive GUI testing tool. It is user friendly and is easy to follow the process and how it works. It is free making it a very accessible tool. One of the issues with Selenium is that the "mouseover" command can cause the test to fail. Simply removing this command will fix this issue, which is a small fix.

SikuliX is another free software. This software allows you to insert screenshots into your test cases which is an incredibly powerful and useful feature. However, it is a quite dated software making it difficult to use and understand today. The other problem with SikuliX is that it is fully manual and does not allow for the easy automation that Selenium offers.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Originally we planned to split the assignment into 4 even sections, with each of us completing a quarter of the mutation testing, and completing 2 use cases for the GUI testing. However due to some technical issues that are discussed in detail in the next section, we were unable to do this. Three of our group members worked on the mutation testing and GUI testing. Our fourth group member focused on GUI testing and working on the report to make up for the missed work. All members contributed to the report but the fourth member took on a bit more of the effort.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

This lab ended up being exceptionally difficult. The PIT mutation testing tool did not work properly on Mac. After running all the mutation tests, the report would be generated, but before it could be analyzed or exported, Eclipse would crash. This was tested several times on a Mac user's machine, but since it took almost 15 minutes to run every time, we had to move on quickly to avoid wasting too much time. Thankfully we had several group members who had powerful Windows machines and were able to run the mutation tests. Because this Assignment also included the GUI testing, we were able to still divide the work up mostly evenly. After much experimentation and collaboration, we were still unable to figure out how to get the PIT testing working on a Mac.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The main issue with this lab was the lack of cross-platform compatibility. Because of the issues mentioned in the previous section, we wasted a large amount of time as a group troubleshooting and trying to get the PIT testing working for all members. It would be appreciated in the future if there was a heads-up about potential issues on specific operating systems. It was also very annoying that running the PIT mutation test could take upwards of 15 minutes each time we wanted to see how much progress has been made when attempting to kill more mutations. This was very time consuming and was a very ineffective way of unit testing. Overall, obtaining an increase of 10% on the mutation score was impossible as well since we already had very high mutation scores for both the Range and DataUtilities tests. This left only very obscure mutations that by no means should ever need to be focused on and even when we did create tests for them, it would not increase the score at all since it only killed one mutation (out of over 650-1250). Creating enough tests to reach an 100% mutation coverage is not reasonabe for the given timeframe as we are all busy and it also does not teach us anything. The lab instructions should be changed in order to cover what to do in this edge case. For example, we have over 120 tests for both these classes which is more tests than actually needed to thoroughly test each class and we still were not able to reach the 10% increase for each class.

It was really appreciated to include a rubric breaking down the contents of the lab report! We found it really helpful when writing the report to have something to reference aside from section headers to make sure we were on the right track.
