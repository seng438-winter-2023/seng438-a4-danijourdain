# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
We designed our test cases around the Ikea web page and divided it such that each member in our group covers two tests. Find below the tests covered by each team member and an explination at why we covered those tests.

Ethan
1. Search for an item using a photo
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click on the camera found in the search bar
    - Select the picture with a night stand and bed
    - Select DVALA
2. Add item to shopping list while not logged in
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click the menu at the top left of the page
    - Select Products --> Home decor --> Mirrors
    - Click on Large Mirrors and then select NISSEDAL
    - Press on the heart to add it to your shopping list
    - Select the heart at the top of the page to go to your shopping list
    - Refresh the page to ensure it stays in your shopping list
    - Press on the NISSEDAL mirror and then remove it from your shopping list
Explination: The first test case will allow users to search for items that they do not necissarily know the name of or even find items that fit their current room by uploading their own photo. This will help the user recieve results that are much more relevant to them. The second test case will allow us to look at if the site runs properly for users  who do not have an account. This specifically checks to see if these users can search for items that interest them and then save those items to their wish list/shopping list. Refreshing the page allows us to ensure that their choices are saved even when they leave the page if they want to come back to them later in order to buy the items.
