# Introduction

This assignment built two different software testing skills. The first one that was tested was mutation testing. This was done using the Pitest PIT mutation tool. This allowed us to improve the coverage of our test suite from the last two assignments even further by applying more test development techniques. The second half of this lab shifted focus to GUI testing. This was done by using Selenium to test a popular shopping website. These tests focued on testing popular and common use cases for the site. 

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

We designed our test cases around the Ikea web page and divided it such that each member in our group covers two tests. Find below the tests covered by each team member and an explination at why we covered those tests.

1. Search for an item using a photo
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click on the camera found in the search bar
    - Select the picture with a night stand and bed
    - Select DVALA
2. Add item to shopping list while not logged in
    - Start on the landing page of the Ikea web store
    - Click the menu at the top left of the page
    - Select Products --> Home decor --> Mirrors
    - Click on Large Mirrors and then select NISSEDAL
    - Press on the heart to add it to your shopping list
    - Select the heart at the top of the page to go to your shopping list
    - Refresh the page to ensure it stays in your shopping list
    - Press on the NISSEDAL mirror and then remove it from your shopping list
Explination: The first test case will allow users to search for items that they do not necissarily know the name of or even find items that fit their current room by uploading their own photo. This will help the user recieve results that are much more relevant to them. The second test case will allow us to look at if the site runs properly for users  who do not have an account. This specifically checks to see if these users can search for items that interest them and then save those items to their wish list/shopping list. Refreshing the page allows us to ensure that their choices are saved even when they leave the page if they want to come back to them later in order to buy the items.

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Originally we planned to split the assignment into 4 even sections, with each of us completing a quarter of the mutation testing, and completing 2 use cases for the GUI testing. However due to some technical issues that are discussed in detail in the next section, we were unable to do this. Three of our group members worked on the mutation testing and GUI testing. Our fourth group member focused on GUI testing and working on the report to make up for the missed work. All members contributed to the report but the fourth member took on a bit more of the effort.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

This lab ended up being exceptionally difficult. The PIT mutation testing tool did not work properly on Mac. After running all the mutation tests, the report would be generated, but before it could be analyzed or exported, Eclipse would crash. This was tested several times on a Mac user's machine, but since it took almost 15 minutes to run every time, we had to move on quickly to avoid wasting too much time. Thankfully we had several group members who had powerful Windows machines and were able to run the mutation tests. Because this Assignment also included the GUI testing, we were able to still divide the work up mostly evenly. After much experimentation and collaboration, we were still unable to figure out how to get the PIT testing working on a Mac.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The main issue with this lab was the lack of cross-platform compatibility. Because of the issues mentioned in the previous section, we wasted a large amount of time as a group troubleshooting and trying to get the PIT testing working for all members. It would be appreciated in the future if there was a heads-up about potential issues on specific operating systems.

It was really appreciated to include a rubric breaking down the contents of the lab report! We found it really helpful when writing the report to have something to reference aside from section headers to make sure we were on the right track.
